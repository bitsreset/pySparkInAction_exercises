One of your friends come to you with the following code.
They have no idea why it doesnâ€™t work. Can you diagnose the problem,
explain why it is an error and provide a fix?

from pyspark.sql.functions import col, split

book = spark.read.text("1342-0.txt")

book = book.printSchema()

lines = book.select(split(book.value, " ").alias("line"))

words = lines.select(explode(col("line")).alias("word"))

Fixed Code: to import 'explode' from pyspark.sql.functions

from pyspark.sql.functions import col, split, explode
book = spark.read.text("1342-0.txt")

book = book.printSchema()

lines = book.select(split(book.value, " ").alias("line"))

words = lines.select(explode(col("line")).alias("word"))
